Project Overview and Next Steps

1. Project Goals
Maintain a dynamic Zora coin image on Base mainnet (token 0xc49f424da334e03e089b10dba6061e183e08b7b2)

Automatically scramble a base PNG in response to new ERC-20 Transfer events

Convert the scrambled design (SVG) into a PNG and pin it to IPFS (Pinata)

Update the on-chain tokenURI with the new ipfs://CID so the coin’s image on Zora reflects real-time trading activity

Run as a cron job (every 5 minutes) on a hosting platform (e.g., Render)

Key Components
Environment & Config (.env + constants.ts)

RPC endpoint (BASE_RPC_URL), private key, token address, deploy block

Pinata API keys, fetch batch size, canvas/grid settings (512 × 512, block size 16, etc.)

Parsing and verifying each required variable at runtime

Transfer Fetcher (fetchTransactions.ts)

Connects to Base mainnet via Viem public client using BASE_RPC_URL

Reads lastProcessedBlock (persisted in data/lastBlock.txt or from .env DEPLOY_BLOCK)

Queries events in blocks [lastProcessedBlock … latestBlock] (clamped by FETCH_BATCH_SIZE)

Filters for valid ERC-20 Transfer logs matching the token address

Converts logs into TokenTransaction objects with { hash, blockNumber, from, to, amount, isBuy }

SVG Generator (svgGenerator.ts)

Loads background.png (on-disk) or background.b64 (if shipped) and constructs a full data-URI:

bash
Copy
Edit
data:image/png;base64,<…base64 string…>
Splits the image into an N × N grid (canvas size 512 / block size 16 → 32×32 cells)

For each new transaction, seeds a small RNG with its hash → deterministically chooses which block(s) to move/rotate/tint

Generates an SVG document that:

Embeds the base image via <image xlink:href="data:image/png;base64,…" />

Defines <clipPath> for each grid cell

Applies <use> or <g> with transform="translate(...) rotate(...)" to reposition or rotate blocks

Outputs the final SVG as a UTF-8 string (written to a temp path, e.g., /tmp/output.svg)

PNG Conversion (convertSvgToPng.ts)

Invokes the CairoSVG command-line tool (cairosvg) with:

bash
Copy
Edit
cairosvg /tmp/output.svg --output /tmp/output.png
Reads /tmp/output.png into a Buffer and returns it for pinning

Relies on CairoSVG being installed on the host (Python environment)

IPFS Uploader (ipfsUploader.ts)

Uses Pinata’s Web3 SDK (pinata-web3) or legacy @pinata/sdk to authenticate via PINATA_API_KEY + PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY

Pins the PNG Buffer, obtains a CID

Returns "ipfs://<CID>" (no need to prepend gateway URL)

Contract Updater (updateContractURI.ts)

Creates a Viem wallet client with RPC_URL + PRIVATE_KEY

Instantiates Zora’s Coin SDK with that client and the deployed coin address

Builds a minimal metadata JSON (with image: "ipfs://<CID>", plus any fields Zora requires)

Sends an on-chain transaction to setTokenURI (or appropriate function)

Waits for confirmation and returns the minted tx hash

Orchestrator Stub (index.ts)

Currently only calls fetchTransactions() and logs the result

Needs to be extended into:

csharp
Copy
Edit
const txs = await fetchTransactions();
if (txs.length === 0) return; 
const png = await generatePng(txs);
const cid = await uploadToIPFS(png);
await updateContractURI(cid);
3. Major Gaps & Identified Issues
Orchestrator Not Wired Up

index.ts only fetches logs and logs to console.

No chain of calls to generate image, pin to IPFS, or update on-chain URI.

State Persistence & Idempotence

No record of lastProcessedBlock in data/.

Each run rescans overlapping block ranges → duplicate processing, wasted IPFS pins, wasted gas.

Deterministic Scrambling

Current RNG: uses Math.random().

That yields different results on each run for the same tx set → no repeatable test fixture.

Need a seeded RNG per tx hash to ensure the same scramble for a given transaction.

Background Image Handling

Both background.png and a pre-generated background.b64 exist.

Pre-shipping a static .b64 is fine, but code currently expects a full data-URI, not a bare base-64 string.

Either load from background.png at runtime and encode, or fix code to prefix data:image/png;base64,… around background.b64.

File Paths & Cleanup

SVG/PNG written under src/ currently → if committed or if TypeScript watches, may conflict.

Best practice: write to dist/ (compiled folder) or a temp directory (/tmp or ./data/tmp).

Clean up old files after pinning (so disk doesn’t fill up).

CairoSVG Dependency

Requires Python environment with CairoSVG on PATH.

Hosting must install cairosvg (pip install cairosvg) or equivalent.

If missing, conversion will fail silently or crash.

Deprecated & Vulnerable Dependencies

@pinata/sdk → deprecated in favor of pinata-web3.

Deep-dependency warnings: multibase, multicodec, cids, etc., but these come transitively via IPFS libraries.

Need to run npm audit fix and upgrade any direct dependencies.

Schedule regular dependency audits to catch new vulnerabilities.

Error Handling & Logging

Minimal logging: if IPFS fails or contract update fails, the app likely throws uncaught errors.

Should wrap each step in try/catch, log the precise failure, and exit non-zero so cron can alert.

Configuration Validation

.env variables are present, but no code currently validates their existence or correct format (e.g., that ROTATION_ANGLES splits into an array of numbers).

Use a library like dotenv-safe or add manual checks in constants.ts.

4. Detailed Implementation Strategy
A. Preparation and Hygiene
Clean Repository

Remove any checked-in node_modules/. Verify via git ls-files | grep node_modules.

Ensure .gitignore contains:

lua
Copy
Edit
node_modules/
dist/
data/tmp/
output.svg
output.png
Delete local node_modules/ and run npm install. Address any security warnings:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm audit fix
npm audit
If direct dependencies are deprecated (e.g., @pinata/sdk), replace with recommended alternatives (pinata-web3).

Verify .env Configuration

Confirm presence of all required keys:

objectivec
Copy
Edit
BASE_RPC_URL, PRIVATE_KEY, TOKEN_ADDRESS, DEPLOY_BLOCK,
PINATA_API_KEY, PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY,
FETCH_BATCH_SIZE, FETCH_DELAY_MS,
CANVAS_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE, SCALE_MIN, SCALE_MAX,
ROTATION_ANGLES, TINT_OPACITY
Add an .env.example file with placeholders and descriptions.

Host Environment Setup

CairoSVG: Install on local machine and on target host (Render, Docker image, etc.)

Node: Ensure Node ≥ 16 and a Python 3 environment are available on the host

Cron Schedule: Confirm in render.yaml that npx tsx src/index.ts will run every 5 minutes

B. State Management & Idempotence
Persist lastProcessedBlock

On successful run (after updateContractURI), write the highest block number processed to data/lastBlock.txt.

On startup, read that file; if absent, use DEPLOY_BLOCK from .env.

In fetchTransactions, query only blocks higher than lastProcessedBlock, up to (latestBlock - FETCH_DELAY_MS).

Optional: Track Processed Hashes

If multiple transfers can occur in the same block, but you only want to process each once, store an in-memory or on-disk set of processed tx hashes.

At the end of each run, append new hashes to data/processedTxs.json.

Early Exit Logic

If fetchTransactions returns an empty array, log “No new transfers” and exit 0.

This avoids unnecessary image generation, IPFS pinning, or on-chain updates.

C. Deterministic Scrambling
Seeded RNG Implementation

Select a small, simple RNG (e.g., a linear-congruential generator) seeded with the numerical value of the transaction hash (e.g., first 8 bytes).

For each TokenTransaction, derive a seed:

ini
Copy
Edit
seed = parseInt(tx.hash.slice(2, 18), 16)
rng = new LCG(seed)
Use rng.next() to choose which grid cell(s) to shuffle, how to rotate or tint, ensuring if the same tx hash is processed twice, the visual effect is identical.

Apply Mutations

For each tx in chronological order:

Call rng to pick (x,y) indices of grid cell(s) to move

Call rng again (if needed) to pick rotationAngle from the array [0, 90, 180, 270]

Optionally apply a tintOpacity or scale derived from SCALE_MIN/SCALE_MAX and rng

The cumulative effect of processing all new txs yields a final scrambled arrangement.

D. SVG Generation Flow
Load Background Image

In constants.ts, add a helper:

ts
Copy
Edit
const rawPng = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "../background.png"))
const backgroundDataUri = `data:image/png;base64,${rawPng.toString("base64")}`
Export backgroundDataUri for use in svgGenerator.

Build SVG Document

Define <svg width="512" height="512" viewBox="0 0 512 512"> root

Embed <image href="${backgroundDataUri}" width="512" height="512" /> as the base layer

For each of the 32×32 grid cells, define a <clipPath id="clip-${i}-${j}"> that selects that cell’s rectangle

After computing shuffle instructions for each cell, use <g clip-path="url(#clip-i-j)" transform="translate(dx,dy) rotate(r,xCenter,yCenter)">

Inside each <g>, put the same <image> reference; the clip ensures only that cell’s piece is drawn

Write the entire resulting SVG string to /tmp/output.svg

Validation & Logging

Before writing:

Confirm CANVAS_SIZE % BLOCK_SIZE === 0 (e.g., 512 ÷ 16 = 32)

Confirm ROTATION_ANGLES.split(",") are valid integers

After writing: log “SVG written to /tmp/output.svg (size X KB)”.

E. PNG Conversion & IPFS Pinning
Invoke CairoSVG

Run a child process:

bash
Copy
Edit
cairosvg /tmp/output.svg --output /tmp/output.png
Capture stdout/stderr; if exit code ≠ 0, log the error detail and exit non-zero.

Read PNG Buffer

fs.readFileSync("/tmp/output.png") → Buffer (size ~X KB)

Log “PNG buffer ready (size = X bytes)”.

Pin to Pinata

Use pinata-web3 (latest) or legacy @pinata/sdk:

Authenticate with PINATA_API_KEY & PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY

Call pinFromBuffer(pngBuffer, { pinataMetadata: { name: "zora-coin-<timestamp>" } })

On success: receive CID (string)

Log “Pinned to IPFS: CID = <CID>”.

Error Handling

If Pinata responds with rate-limit or 5xx error, retry up to 2 more times with a small delay (FETCH_DELAY_MS)

If still failing, log error and exit non-zero—host will notify via cron failure.

F. On-Chain Metadata Update
Create Wallet Client

Use Viem:

ts
Copy
Edit
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet.base,
  transport: http(JSON_RPC_URL),
  account: privateKeyToAccount(PRIVATE_KEY),
});
Initialize Zora’s Coin SDK with this walletClient and tokenAddress.

Build Metadata JSON

Minimal required fields (per Zora spec):

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Dynamic Zora Coin",
  "description": "Base64-scrambled snapshot reflecting Base trading activity.",
  "image": "ipfs://<CID>",
  /* Any additional fields your coin metadata requires */
}
Send Transaction

Call zoraCoin.setTokenURI(1, "<metadataUri>") (or correct function signature)

Wait for confirmation. Log “On-chain URI updated: txHash = 0x…”.

State Update

After confirmation, write data/lastBlock.txt = <highestBlockProcessed>

Optionally append data/processedTxs.json with all new hash values.

Error Scenarios

Insufficient gas: log “Gas estimate failed” and exit non-zero

Nonce conflict: log “Nonce too low/high, possible double-run” → consider incrementing a local nonce tracker

Network timeout: retry up to 2× (with small backoff) before giving up

5. Development Workflow & Best Practices
Branching & Version Control

Use feature branches (e.g., feat/orchestrator, fix/state, refactor/pinata-sdk)

Open PRs with clear titles (“Add lastProcessedBlock persistence”, “Switch to pinata-web3”)

Require at least one approving review before merging into main

Continuous Integration (CI)

Configure GitHub Actions (or your preferred CI) to run on every PR:

npm ci

npm run build (TypeScript compile)

npm test (unit & integration tests)

npm audit --production (fail on new vulnerabilities)

Unit & Integration Testing

Unit tests for:

fetchTransactions: mock RPC client, return a fixed eth_getLogs response → assert you get expected TokenTransaction[]

svgGenerator: feed a known set of tx hashes → check the resulting SVG matches a stored fixture

ipfsUploader: mock Pinata SDK to return a fake CID → assert you handle it correctly

updateContractURI: mock Zora Coin SDK → assert you call the correct function with correct arguments

Integration test (local or testnet):

Spin up a Ganache-fork of Base mainnet at DEPLOY_BLOCK

Deploy a local test Zora coin contract, mint a few ERC-20 tokens, run a dummy transfer

Run your full index.ts flow (with a “dry-run” flag for on-chain update) → confirm the PNG is generated and the metadata URI is built correctly

Logging & Monitoring

Use a logger that timestamps every line; include context tags ([fetch], [svg], [pinata], [zora])

On a successful run, output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[fetch ] 3 new transfers (blocks 30,305,954–30,306,020)
[svg   ] Generated SVG → /tmp/output.svg (24 KB)
[png   ] Generated PNG → /tmp/output.png (263 KB)
[pinata] Pinned to IPFS: CID Qm…
[zora  ] Updated tokenURI: tx 0xabc… Confirmed
[state ] Wrote lastBlock = 30306020
On any failure, log full error stack and exit with process.exit(1). The hosting cron job will detect non-zero exit and send an alert.

Configuration Validation

In constants.ts, after loading process.env, validate:

All required variables exist (fail early if missing)

Numeric values (CANVAS_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE, etc.) parse to integers and make sense (CANVAS_SIZE % BLOCK_SIZE === 0)

ROTATION_ANGLES splits into an array of valid numbers

If any check fails, log a clear message (e.g., “ROTATION_ANGLES must be comma-separated integers”) and exit.

6. Host Deployment & Scheduling
Render.com Setup

Create a new service:

Environment: Node 16+ (with Python 3 and CairoSVG installed)

Start Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx tsx dist/index.js
Cron Schedule:

markdown
Copy
Edit
*/5 * * * *
Add all .env variables in Render’s dashboard (matching your local .env).

Configure “Health check” endpoint if desired (e.g., expose a small Express server that returns “OK” if last run succeeded).

Monitoring & Alerts

Enable email or Slack notifications for build failures or non-zero exits.

Keep a small log file (data/logs.txt) of the last 50 runs (append timestamp + success/failure).

If Pinata or Zora API rate limits appear (HTTP 429 or 5xx), extend FETCH_DELAY_MS or introduce exponential backoff

Long-Term Maintenance

Enable Dependabot or Renovate to open PRs for patch/minor upgrades.

Every quarter:

Review the audit report (npm audit) and resolve new issues

Upgrade IPFS-related deep dependencies (e.g., move from ipfs-http-client to Helia)

Test against new CairoSVG versions to ensure no rendering regressions

7. Detailed App Flow (End-to-End)
Startup & Config Check

index.ts (compiled to dist/index.js) runs

constants.ts loads process.env, validates each variable, and computes backgroundDataUri

Attempt “health checks”:

Verify cairosvg on PATH (run which cairosvg)

Ping RPC (eth_blockNumber)

Optionally, call Pinata’s authentication endpoint

Fetch New Transfers

Read data/lastBlock.txt; if missing, use DEPLOY_BLOCK from .env

Connect to Base RPC via Viem, query logs for blocks (lastProcessedBlock + 1) … latestBlock (capped by FETCH_BATCH_SIZE)

Filter for valid ERC-20 Transfer events for TOKEN_ADDRESS

Convert to TokenTransaction[]; if empty, log “no new transfers” and exit(0)

Generate Scrambled SVG

For each tx in chronological order, derive seeded RNG from tx.hash

Determine which grid cells to move/rotate/tint according to RNG outputs and .env settings (BLOCK_SIZE, ROTATION_ANGLES, TINT_OPACITY)

Build SVG DOM: embed <image href="backgroundDataUri" />, define <clipPath>s, apply transform blocks

Write to /tmp/output.svg; log file size

Convert SVG → PNG

Run cairosvg /tmp/output.svg --output /tmp/output.png as a child process

If success, read /tmp/output.png into a Buffer; log “PNG buffer size = X bytes”

If failure, log error stack and exit(1)

Pin PNG to IPFS

Instantiate Pinata client (pinata-web3) with API keys from .env

Call pinFromBuffer(pngBuffer, metadata)

On success, receive CID; log it

On temporary failure (rate limit, network error), retry up to 2× with small delay; if still failing, exit(1)

Update On-Chain Metadata

Create a Viem wallet client from BASE_RPC_URL + PRIVATE_KEY

Initialize Zora Coin SDK with TOKEN_ADDRESS

Build metadata JSON (name, description, image: "ipfs://<CID>", etc.)

Send setTokenURI(tokenId, metadataUri) (or correct function)

Wait for confirmation; log “txHash = 0x…”

On transient failure (nonce conflict, network error), retry up to 2×; on persistent error, exit(1)

Persist State & Cleanup

Write data/lastBlock.txt = <highestBlockProcessed>

Optionally append new tx hashes to data/processedTxs.json

Delete /tmp/output.svg and /tmp/output.png to free space

Log “Run completed successfully at <timestamp>” and exit(0)

8. Forward-Looking Error Checking & Resilience
Config Validation:

Fail fast if any required .env key is missing or invalid (e.g. non-numeric CANVAS_SIZE).

Exit with code 1 and clear error message.

Dependency Checks:

On startup, verify which cairosvg works; if not, log “CairoSVG not found—install Python 3 + pip install cairosvg” and exit.

Test RPC connectivity: if eth_blockNumber call fails, log “RPC unreachable” and exit.

Network & Rate Limit Handling:

Wrap Pinata pin calls with retry logic (e.g., 3 total attempts with exponential backoff).

If RPC calls return 429 or 5xx, retry up to configurable FETCH_RETRY_COUNT (set in .env if desired).

On repeated failures, alert via non-zero exit (cron job detects failure).

Gas & On-Chain Edge Cases:

Estimate gas before sending setTokenURI; if estimate fails, log details, “Gas estimate failed for metadata update” → exit.

If transaction reverts (insufficient permissions, nonce too low), surface that exact revert message to logs.

File System & Disk Quota:

Always write to a temp directory with a known path (e.g., /tmp).

After a successful upload, delete intermediate files.

If /tmp write fails (out of space, permission denied), log and exit.

Unexpected Exceptions:

Wrap the entire main() in try { … } catch (err) { console.error(err); process.exit(1); }

This guarantees any unhandled exception causes a non-zero exit (cron job will alert).

Logging Granularity:

Tag logs with categories ([fetch], [svg], [pinata], [zora], [state]) and timestamps.

On success, log concise summary; on failure, log full stack trace.

9. Efficiency Considerations
Limit Block Window:

Use FETCH_BATCH_SIZE (e.g., 1000 blocks) so you never fetch more than needed.

If your token is low-volume, likely fewer than 10 transfers in 1000 blocks.

Minimal SVG Complexity:

Use one <image> element and multiple <clipPath> + <use> statements instead of embedding 32×32 separate <image> tags.

That keeps SVG text size small (~20–50 KB), minimizing CairoSVG parsing time.

Avoid Redundant Work:

If no new transfers, skip SVG generation, PNG conversion, and IPFS pinning.

Persist state immediately after on-chain update so you never redo a block range.

Parallelism Caution:

Don’t run multiple instances concurrently—race conditions around lastBlock.txt, nonces, or Pinata rate limits.

Only schedule a single cron job every 5 minutes. If one run takes longer, fail early or skip overlapping runs.

Lightweight Testing Harness:

Use fixtures for SVG → expected PNG bytes (or hash) so you can run quick unit tests without hitting external services.

Mock Pinata and Zora calls in CI to keep tests fast.
